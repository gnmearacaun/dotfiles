#### ZSH Prompt is: Go Bullet Train (GBT) https://github.com/jtyr/gbt

I slimmed down my zshrc, removed oh-my-zsh and have vi-mode, syntax, and auto-completion working. Fzf too.

My init.vim is no longer current. Lot of stuff in there. I have migrated over to my fork of [LunaVim](https://github.com/gnmearacaun/LunarVim), a featureful Neovim text-editing environment.

I plan to use Gnu Stow to backup all my dotfiles soon.
